#Shopping List Check Off App

### Coursera AngularJS - Module 2 Assignment

Users can check off items from a "To Buy" list and app moves each bought item to an "Already Bought" list.

Note: app has a minified version of app.js (app.min.js), minified using [https://javascript-minifier.com/](https://javascript-minifier.com/). It currently is loading app.js (so that graders can easily read through the code; app.min.js wouldn't make much sense to read through), but the minified version is fully functional.
